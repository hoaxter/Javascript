        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript is a programming interface for web documents (HTML, XML, and SVG). It represents the structure of a document as a logical tree of objects, where each node in the tree represents a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text.</p>

<script>
    console.log(window); //its a complex object  // it contain many other objects and methods
    console.log(window.document); // it contain the body and structure of the web page
    console.log(document); // the document is used so much that we can directly access it without using windows.
    console.dir(document); // we have seen in windows that document have many other info but it was just showing html sturcture so we use dir to see the complete object we have more like doucment.warning , document.title etc
    console.log(document.contentType); // it will give us the content type of the page
    console.log(document.baseURI); // will give us the base uri of the page  // uri stands for uniform resource identifier it is same as url the difference is url is a subset of uri eg url is a web address but uri can be anything like email address, phone number etc
    console.log(document.links); // it will show two links and its show result in htmlcollection which is not an array // we cannot use array methods on it
    console.log(document.links[1]); // but we can access links through index
    console.log(document.getElementById('firstHeading'));  // we can select an element using its id, it returns the element only as its unique.
    document.getElementById('firstHeading').innerHTML = "2"; // here we are selecting the element using its id and manipulating it using innerHTML that change the element with its html structure
    console.log(document.getElementsByClassName("heading")); // we can select an element using its class name , it returns the htmlcollection as class name can be used in for multiple elements
    document.getElementsByClassName('heading')[0].innerHTML = "<h1>we are learning DOM</h1>" // here we are selecting the element using its class and giving the array number to select the particular element of that class and manipulating it using innerHTML that change the element with its html structure

// DOM JavaScript ke andar ek aisa object hai jo hume webpage ke structure ko manipulate karne ka access deta hai.
// har ek webpage ka ek DOM hota hai jo us webpage ke structure ko represent karta hai
